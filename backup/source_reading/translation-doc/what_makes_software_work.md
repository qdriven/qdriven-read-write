## How do you get those?

Every manager dreams of having great strategic leader and excellent developers,but how?

- luck
- choice
- grow them
  * trust, in particular, always needs nurturing
  * you can always teach a little
  * you can always learn a lot

## Two scary monster

- develop wrong software: percentages of blame

some books here:
- behind closed doors
  once you have four or more people in your group, you can't perform technical work and still be a great manager
- peopleware: productive project and teams
  managers are not usually part of the teams that they manage... leadership just doesn't have much place here.

## One way to be an HTM (Highly technical Manager)
M as a technical manager for a group of the developers

- M can nurture mutual trust, interaction and respect by and for the developers by deploying hime/herself as a "wildcard" technical resource
- not for the fun tasks,but rather
- for urgent ones requiring an extra pair of hands brain hemispheres right now
- be they fun or preferably chores

- schedule many,regular,shot meeting
- never a problem if a meeting ends early
- cancelable at last minute in emergencies
- always,promptly take sidelines offline
- punctuality saves time for everyone
- always think about who should be there easy but wrong to slip into a when in doubt,invite them mentality
- always be ready to snatch opportunities

## Time mgmt 102 tips

- Consider each piece of work specifically
  * does it really need to be done at all
  * if so, am I the best person to do it
  * &,when should it optimally be done?
- don't let emergencies emerge
- schedule ~50% of your "discretionary" time each week for not-(yet!)-urgent fillers
  * a wise general strives to keep a reserve
  * can be rescheduled for emerging work
  * don't wait util they are urgent
- Trust
  * Trust by default(pre-req: hiring very selectively)
  * earn & deserve developers' trust:
    - technical ability & technical currency
    - true, not faked, interest in them as individuals,within and outside work
    - always give recognition and credit
  * developers must earn & deserve yours
    - tech skills,integrity,goal-focusing
  * trust begins at home

## Neglection "real" Mgmt

- no real management task than this set of tasks: nurturing trust,caring for your people, helping teams jell
  ,helping your people grow, focusing on goals and priorities
- nothing wrong with writing some unit-tests,critiquing a design or slogging though a deucedly(intensives) hard debugging session,since it helps you accomplish all of these tasks
- learn all you can about your developers,specific,individual,strengths & weaknesses
- play to their strengths
- help them to outgrow weaknesses: coaching,lessons,books, pairing, run a marathon not a 100-m dash
- making unreasonable demands can burn them out(watch out for burnout)
- making only fully reasonable demands provides no challenge(stretch goals)
